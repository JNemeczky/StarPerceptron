# StarPerceptron

The dataset that I chose contains 7 variables including the target variable and has
39552 rows. It includes information about stars with the predictor variables such
as “Visual Apparent Magnitude of the Star”, “Distance Between the Star and the
Earth” and “B-V color index”. The target variable is whether or not the star is
considered a Dwarf (0) or a Giant (1). In this project I will use perceptrons to try 
and predict the target variable given all of the predictor variables. By changing the
learning rate and the number of epochs I attempted to find the perceptron that had the 
highest rate of stars correctly identified.
